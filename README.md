### Model Training Summary

#### Initial Issue
The model initially struggled to converge due to a small learning rate. The learning rate was set too low, causing the model to update weights very slowly and preventing it from reaching the minimum point of the loss function.

#### Solution
To address this issue, the learning rate was increased. This adjustment allowed the model to update weights more effectively and converge to the minimum point of the loss function.

#### Training Accuracy
After the learning rate adjustment, the model achieved high accuracy on the training set. This indicates that the model was able to learn the patterns in the training data effectively.

#### Validation Accuracy
The accuracy on the validation set plateaued after a certain number of epochs. This plateau suggested that further training on the training set did not lead to improvements in validation performance. However, after additional epochs, the validation accuracy began to increase again, indicating some delayed improvements.

#### Final Loss
By the end of the training process, the loss for the training set was nearly zero. Despite this, the model did not overfit, as evidenced by the low loss values for both the validation and test sets. This balance suggests that the model was able to learn the training data well without memorizing it, maintaining good performance on unseen data.

#### Generalization
The model demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. It performed well on unseen data, as indicated by the low loss and reasonable accuracy on the validation and test sets. This suggests that the model was able to capture the underlying patterns in the data rather than just memorizing the training examples.
